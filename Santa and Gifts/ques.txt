There are N(1e5) children whose goodness level is given by an array a (1<=a[i]<=1e9). Santa gives each child b[i] coins (1<=b[i]<=N) . A child who has more goodness level should receive more coins, same goodness level should receive same coins and less goodness level should receive fewer coins.
Print the number of ways in which Santa can distribute the coins among the N children.(%1e9+7)
Also, print the array b such that the number of coins spent by Santa is maximum
